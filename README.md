Tomato Leaf disease image classification using ML model Inception V3


For more details try to follow a similar approach to the "Using-Deep-Learning-to-identify-pneumonia" repository in my github profile.


To find the dataset for the given notebook click on the link below :

Running the model for just 10 epochs gave me a val_accuracy of 0.85

Also some more hyperparameter tuning is required to improve our model further in order to improve our classification accuracy.
